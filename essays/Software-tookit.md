Software Engineering – A great tool to have

I feel like my interest in software engineering comes from a necessity to utilize it.  It isn’t exactly that I am super passionate about programming, but more that I enjoy making things and software engineering is one of the limitations I face when implementing my ideas.   I previously went to school for electronics.  I received two associates degrees in electronics last year.  I often times felt the same way about electronics in the past.  I had all these ideas and concepts that I wanted to build, but I was limited in my understanding of electronics, so I went to school to learn electronics since that had always been a limitation for me.  Now I am lead electronics engineer on a really cool underwater ROV project for the University of Manoa.

Software Engineering is much the same thing.  I often find myself working on digital electronic systems and needed to understand more of what was happening behind the scenes, on the software side.  I started out learning Arduino, which implements a version of C++ to control the micro controller.  I was able to use Arduino to create specialized inventions in my day to day life.  I worked in agriculture and found all sorts of ways I could use electronics and programming to control and manipulate environmental conditions around the farm.  One innovation in particular would open and close a door for my chickens when the sun came up. 

As time went on my interests progressed beyond just the practical. I wanted to learn programming just to see what I could accomplish.  I wanted to teach myself things like tensorflow and unity and try to see if I could learn about artificial intelligence and video games.  I would spend weeks watching YouTube tutorials but I always felt like I was stumbling around randomly and hoping I could coach myself though whatever project I had in mind.  Sometimes this would work, but often times I would find myself at a dead end where a concept progress too far for me to understand.  It was time a formal education would be required for me to learn the things I needed to know.

Around the time I was finishing my associates in Electronics I made the decision to continue my education towards a bachelor’s degree.  I had the option to continue my path learning electronics, or I could add another tool too my toolkit like computer science.  I applied to universities for both, CSU Long beach for Electronics Engineering, and UH Manoa for Computer Science.  I was accepted to both but decided that diversifying my skill set would be helpful for me to achieve my goal of eventually working in the robotics field, plus the surf in Hawaii was better than Long beach.  So my path to software engineering may not have been the most straight forward, but I think it will be a great tool to have!
