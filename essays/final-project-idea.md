UH Surfbreaks App

Overview

The problem : Students come from all over the world to UH Manoa, and part of having complete experience at UH manoa, would be to try surfing.  Students come from various skill levels and would like to know the most suitable location for them to surf in Oahu.
The solution: The UH Surfing app could be used to help UH students identify the surfbreaks most suitable for their skill level based on swell direction and season.  This App could help students find the best breaks closest to them.


The idea behind this app is to list and categorize various beaches and Surfbreaks around UH Manoa and Oahu.  The breaks could be listed by distance from campus, by skill level, wave direction (lefts or rights), ideal swell directions, and ideal swell sizes.  This app could be helpful for the students who have come to UH Manoa from other places and would like to know which beaches would be ideal to surf for their skill level.  Maybe we could include potential hazards as well and a basic descirption of the location.  We could also add additional information to the app such as other activities that could be done at the beaches, such as swimming, snorkeling, volleyball or scuba diving.  We plan on having two roles, an administrative role as well as a basic user role.  Users can view the places while admins can make changes.  Different tabs could be used to reflect different skill level or other categories.  A user can specify skill level and get various suggestions based on their skill level.  User logs in, sets up profiles and can browse or receive suggestions.  We could also implement a rating system where users can rate the breaks.  Depending on how far we get maybe some beyond the basics features could be implemented, user generated reviews of places or maybe a chat area where people can discuss.

Mockup page ideas
 - landing page with card and information on various breaks
     - distance from campus, by skill level,
     - wave direction (lefts or rights),
     - ideal swell directions
     - ideal swell sizes.
 - Break pages - Maybe each break could have its own page with more information as well as pictures
 - User profile page - skill levels and user details
 - Discovery page?
 - Admin Homepage
 - Edit page


 Use case ideas
  - Students new to the area who would like to try surfing
  - Students from Hawaii who have never tried surfing
  - Students with some experience surfing who would like to know suitable locations for their level of skill
  - Advanced surfers looking for the best waves on a particular swell
  - Finding closest breaks to campus
  - Finding new surf spots
  - Avoiding bad surf spots and knowing of potential hazards ahead of time


Beyond the basics
  - rating system
  - maybe a chat area or meetup room
  - Maybe classifieds to list used surfboards and equipment
  - Surf Instructors
  - Surf spot log
