Designed a game entirely in unity.  Scripting done entirely from scratch in VSCode C# for Unity.  Complete four level game with enemies and items.  This game utilized the sprites and graphics from the original NES Zelda game to create a randomized 4 level game with complete with four unique bosses, four randomized dungeons and complete overworld.  The maps, enemies and item locations were completely randomized making for a unique gameplay experiance every play through the game.  Every dungeon contains an item key, an item, a boss key and a boss.  Each item allowed for the completion of the next dungeon.  The user could never be sure where the items were located or which direction to go.  Enemies randomly spawn in each room and health grew upon completion of every level.  Secret hidden rooms and items were locted in random locations on map, and rupees could be found and spend on conssumable items or to upgrade damage by the sword.  Project took several months to complete, and a full playable game was created upon completion.
