The Legend of Design Patterns

For anyone unfamiliar with videogames, there is a game called the Legend of Zelda.  It has been around since the original Nintendo Entertainment System, and its sequels have been made for every Nintendo system ever since, from “Zelda: Ocarina of Time” for N64 to “Breath of the Wild” for Nintendo Switch.  The legend of design Zelda has become a cornerstone of the Nintendo franchise.  The story is always something about rescuing a Princess Zelda, and you must work your way through all the dungeons collecting various items to save her.  A key part of the game is that every dungeon tends to have a new obstacle that you cannot conquer with your current inventory of items.  But if you look around the dungeon you will find a new tool, weapon or item that will help to get past the new obstacle.  Maybe it’s a key to open a door, a bow to shoot an arrow to a far away switch, or a special shirt that makes you immune to lava, there is always a problem that you encounter, but nearby is always your solution.  

Design patterns are like the tools that you find in Zelda that help you on your quest.  Maybe the first time you see a puzzle in Zelda, you are not sure what you need to do, but after you find the right tool in your inventory, you can solve that puzzle right away and get to new places in the land of Hyrule.   Maybe you need to activate a switch that you can’t reach, in Zelda you might find an arrow or boomerang that can hit a switch from a distance.   A design can be useful the same way, in your real-life programming dungeons.  

Sometimes you reach a problem or puzzle in your code, and you don’t currently know the best way to solve it.  A design pattern might be the tool that you find to solve that part of your code.  After you have used a design pattern a few times, you figure out when it is appropriate and what types of situations it can help you in.   These are like the puzzles you encounter in Zelda.  Maybe they were difficult or impossible before, but once you find the right tool for the job it opens up your entire world and takes you to new places in the game, the same way design patterns will open up your world in programming and take your programming to new places.

Much like the game, in the world of programming there are oftentimes more than one suitable tool for the job.  For example many items can activate switches, sometimes it doesn’t matter what you use, but there are cases when the right tool can make all the difference.  If a switch is far away you can shoot it with a hook shot, if the switch is too far for the hook shot you might need to use an arrow, but this has the downside of wasting an arrow.  If the switch is in another area and you need to be elsewhere when the switch is activated, you can use bomb with a fuse to be elsewhere when the switch is activated.  After you encounter these situations a few times you learn what is the best tool for the job, the same way you learn which design pattern is best to use in your code. 

In the real world instead of searching for the solution in a dungeon, you have to search someplace even darker and scarier, the internet.  Sites like GitHub or stack overflow often have examples of working code that might solve a similar issue to the one you are facing.  One thing I have learned is that rarely am I the first one to experience a problem, so if I can draw on the experience of others who has faced the same problem before me, then I can save myself hours of time and headache down the road.  Why would you want to waste time reinventing the wheel when there might already be a viable solution to your problem.  

One of the interesting things about design patterns is that I had already been using them in the past.  I know the singleton pattern had been a requirement in several of my previous assignments and I have used event handling in videogames I have made in unity.  I also tend to have my own solutions I use when I encounter similar problems and these solutions tend to follow a certain pattern and are in response to a specific type of problem I am trying to solve programming.  Sometimes I learn a new pattern that flat out replaces an old pattern, or sometimes I draw on it for inspiration in solving future problems.  Each design pattern is a key that will open up new doors in your world if you learn how to use them.
