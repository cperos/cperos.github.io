<H1>Surfing the internet for Surf data</H1>
<H2>WaveCache</H2>

This was a project I saw from start to finish.  This is because on the day we had to come up with final project ideas, the surf break data was my pitch to the group.  My project along with one other was selected as additional project ideas for the class and a week or two later when we were randomly assigned to groups, I was assigned to my own project idea.  This seemed like a great match, after all I love surfing, and it was my own idea, but little did I know I would be spending hours upon hours gathering raw data, GPS locations, images and descriptions for all the major surf breaks on Oahu.

<H2>The Team</H2>

When I was randomly selected to work on this project, I was also randomly assigned teammates and I do not think at the start of this project any of us had any prior relationships with each other.  We had a diverse team with members originating from across the globe, from Norway to Hawaii.  It was certainly a new experience seeing how the team wanted to approach the idea I had come up with.  At first you have this vision of what you think the project was meant to be but everybody adds their own interpretations, experiences and ideas and while it can be tempting to want to have control over your vision, I think it was better to let go of my preconceived notion of what the project needed to be and allow room for everyone to add their vision to the project.  Early on we had to get to know each other, at best we had done a couple WODs with each other, but in the beginning we knew very little about each others personalities.  As we got to learn to work together more as a team the project seemed to really come together.

<H2>The Project</H2>

The project combined so many areas of computer science,  Everything from graphic design of the logo, to JavaScript, Programming, deployment, layout of the site, Meteor, React components, managing a team and uploading and working as a group on GitHub.  A lot had to come together from every angle to make this happen as a team.  There were times that this made things hard, but overall I had some very strong and creative teammates that put their knowledge of these concepts into the project and we really made the project come together!

<H2>Meeting the Milestones</H2>

After each teammate meeting or exceeding their goals after 3 milestones it was very satisfying to look over the page and see what we had accomplished.  Of course as with any project or website the idea could have gone on and proceeded indefinitely, with refinement and refinement, but by milestone 3 we had decided to leave the project where it is at.  There are some very cool aspects of the project, we are even able to display weather data from an API, but there are some not as cool aspects as well.

Since I was personally responsible for a few of the short comings they are pretty apparent to me, although they might not seem as visible to a first time user.  One of my biggest flaws was I did not get the profile data from when you sign up to publish to the correct subscription that the profile is supposed to display from, no only that but every time I tried to fix this problem the page would display nothing, but I was able to determine that I store some profile data in a subscription in mini Mongo, it just wasn’t getting accessed correctly.   It isn't a perfect solution, but ultimately I stuck with the mock up data I had originally provided some data is better than no data.

I had been spending too much time trying to solve the problem with the profile data and I wanted to do more to contribute to the finished product, as much of my progress had come to a standstill, that when the opportunity came to help my team add surfspots to the project I was more than ready.  I love surfing  and I thought this could be a great way I could contribute my knowledge and apply it to the project.  Somewhere along the line my group had gotten the idea we needed a minimum of 50 surf spots added to the data set and while it might not sound like a lot, gathering images, GPS coordinates, descriptions and summaries all adds up and it ended up being a larger task than I had originally planned on.  By the time I got halfway one of my teammates informed us that 50 surf spots was probably more than required for the project.  Through my research I may have even discovered a few new surfbreaks worth checking out sometime.

In the end, we were each able to contribute unique ideas and pages to create a page that was uniquely our own.  We were able to add unique ideas, and they formed a cohesive theme representing, the surf, the ocean, what we learned in ICS314 and representing ourselves as well.  We had been given a lot of tools in our toolbox of computer science, and along the way we were givens instructions to use each tool individually,  then at some point we started to put a few of these tools together on assignments lovingly referred to as “Island Snow”  and “Murphy’s”, after mastering a few of these tools in our tool kit we were then able to put them all together on “Digits”.  This project took every tool in our toolkit, forced of to go develop a few of our own tools, not only that, but learn how to demonstrate, communicate and implement those concepts as a team.  This project was more than just a single project it was a collaborative culmination of a semester!
