The Radical Graduate

It's pretty radical to graduate, I hope to do it myself one day, and one tool that could potentially help me do so is RadGrad.  It is an experimental web service for UH Manoa ICS students, and soon to be available for other majors such as computer engineering.  In the age of computer learning, with laulima, discord, zoom, slack, UH Stars plus all the individual class pages, you might as well have one more educational digital service to your life. So, what does RadGrad have to offer that the other sites do not? Well for one it has a review system so you can tell everyone about your favorite (or least favorite) ICS courses.  There are also a variety of tools to help you stay on track with your curricular and extracurricular activities.

The site overall felt better than the html based web pages we made in class last week.  It was able to automatically tell me which classes I had taken within the UH system.  I have heard if you have a lot of non-UH classes this can be a little more time consuming.  The homepage suggested that I update several pages to get my RadGrad profile more current.  It had me fill out reviews on classes I have taken and add classes towards a goal of completing my ICS degree.  It was similar to UH Stars in that regard, except it allowed for extracurricular activities to be added to your schedule as well.

This feature allows you to keep track of potential academic opportunities that you might want to pursue in the future, as well as helps you discover new activities and interests that you might not have heard of before.  Now I gotta be honest, I did have a few issues with RadGrad holding me hostage with its suggestions.  I had added all the opportunities that I realistically thought I might be interested in, but I was still getting suggested to add more to strengthen my profile.  At some point I may have had to add a few things I knew I was never going to do in order to fully strengthen my profile.  At least it is a nice reminder of all the opportunities I have as a student at UH manoa.  

I'm not sure that I would use RadGrad if it weren't for the extra credit, but I think it might be a nice tool for those students who like to plan things ahead.  In the age of data and information, I think it is important to offer a variety of ways for a student to plan their success.  I am not entirely sure what makes RadGrad all that different from the other sites we have for school, but I’m sure there are students out there who can find it useful.  It can be hard to stay focused and easy to forget about a class, school program or activity.  I think RadGrad’s intention is to help you keep those classes and programs in mind, as well as learn about other people’s experiences in those classes or activities.  I haven't quite fully been able to comprehend exactly what else you're supposed to use it for.
